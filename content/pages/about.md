          Before diving into SAT prep, the very first step I recommend is this:
          **download Bluebook and take one full practice test**. Here’s why it
          matters:


          **1. Understand the Test Format and Content**


          Taking a practice test helps you get familiar with the structure of
          the SAT—how the questions are worded and what types of concepts are
          tested. Many students feel anxious before their first SAT, but after
          completing a full practice test, that fear usually fades. You’ll
          realize that most of the content is based on concepts you've already
          encountered in school or previous exams.


          **2. Know Where to Focus Your Prep**


          After finishing the test, you'll get a detailed score report. It shows
          your total score, which questions you got right or wrong, and the
          specific skills you need to improve. This report becomes your starting
          point. Use it to go back, review the questions you missed, understand
          the underlying concepts, and practice similar problems.


          Since there are currently only 7 official digital practice tests
          available, use each one wisely. After every test, reflect not just on
          the score, but on the weak areas. Focused review like this leads to
          real improvement—and real score gains.


          **3. Set a Realistic, Achievable Goal**


          Your first score gives you a baseline. If you score 1000 on your first
          test, don’t expect to jump to 1400 right away. Instead, aim for steady
          progress—perhaps 30–50 points at a time by learning from your
          mistakes. With consistent practice and review, many students see
          significant gains over time.


          Just keep in mind: the higher your starting score, the smaller your
          score jumps will likely be. After all, the max score is 1600!
