          Download bluebook, and take one practice test. There are a few
          benefits for doing so:


          First, you know what SAT tests on and how the questions look like. You
          might have a few irrational fear before taking your SAT, but after the
          first exam, most students get a basic idea of what the exam really is
          about, regardless of the score. The concepts should all be pretty
          familiar or close to what you have encountered in your past learning &
          test taking experience.


          Second, you know where to start prepping. After your first practice
          test, you get a test report that looks like this: 


          It's got your score, answers to each question and suggests you what
          skills to work on. From this, you can revisit the questions and the
          underlying concepts, find similar questions from the question bank and
          improve relevant skills. With every practice test(there're only 7 of
          them for now, so make the full use of them and don't waste them), you
          get a test report, you do a revision not just on the test, but the
          skills where you did poorly on, so that you improve with each test,
          gaining more points will get you more confident and keep studying.


          Finally, you can set a realistic goal for yourself. If your first
          score is 1000, don't expect to raise it to 1400 in the next one.
          Hopefully and realistically, you get incremental successes by properly
          reviewing the wrong questions and get 50 points higher with each test.
          Then after all the practice tests you shall have a go at 1300+. of
          course, the higher score you start from, the smaller increments you
          expect, because the maximum is 1600!
